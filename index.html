    <h2><u>Personal Profile Statement</u></h2>

    <p>
      My full name is Sahar Abdul Waheed. I am 19 years old. I have just
      finished High School and am currently doing a course at Hyperion Dev. I
      love to travel and see new things. A few places that i have been to is
      Cape Town, Pakistan and a few others. I love to meet new people and I have
      recently learnt that I also like doing adventurous sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding has always intrigued me. Finding out exactly how something has been
      created. The effort and time it took to create something that looks
      completely different when it is made is something that has always made me
      curious about whether or not I could do the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also motivates me as knowing that the feeling of creating something
      could be so great. As I further my education, I find that there are many
      careers that interest me - One in particular would be a back-end web
      developer. My experiences with coding are not much at the moment. I do
      know quite a bit of HTML and have created a few websites for High School
      projects.
